# Agile Methodology Reflection

## Prompt

As a group, answer the questions below. For each of these questions, consider specific examples to support your narrative.

- Reflect on your team's communication processes. How did Agile practices, such as **daily stand-up** meetings, facilitate communication and collaboration among team members?
- How did maintaining a **scrum board** play a role in the organization and delegation of tasks in your project?
- Reflect on your team's prioritization of tasks. How did your team create a **timeline for reaching MVP** and how did this prioritization assist in accomplishing your goals?
- What would you have done differently as a group to improve your communication, prioritization, or delegation of tasks?

## Reflection Response

#### Daily Stand-up Meetings

Agile practices like **daily stand-up** meetings played a key role in our team communication because they helped keep us on the same page. Every day we would check in with each other and share updates about:

- The project progress
- Our individual schedules
- Any blockers or challenges

Doing this allowed us to shift plans when needed to accommodate our schedules.

#### Scrum Board Usage

Maintaining the scrum board would have helped keep our project more organized if we had used it more effectively. However, because we had so many API issues during the first couple of days, we weren't able to keep the scrum board updated consistently.

**Key insight:** If we had made the scrum board a priority from the beginning, we probably would have had fewer organizational issues.

#### MVP Prioritization Strategy

To reach our MVP goals, we started by identifying the core features our project needed to function:

1. **API Data Fetching** - Ensuring data is properly retrieved
2. **Data Rendering** - Making sure data displays on the correct pages
3. **Endpoint Accuracy** - Using the correct endpoints based on API documentation

This prioritization helped us focus on essential functionality first.

#### Areas for Improvement

If I could go back, I would incorporate the scrum board into our daily meetings because that would help keep our tasks for the overall project clear and organized.
