## Reflection Response

### Ajene's Response

Agile practices like **daily stand-up** meetings, played a key role in our team communication because it helped keep us on the same page. Everyday we would check in with each other and shared updates about the project and about our schedule. Doing this we were able to shift plans if we needed, to accommodate our schedules.

Maintaining the scrum board would've helped keep our project more organized if we had used it more. But because we had so many API issues the first couple of days we weren't able to keep the scrum board updated. If we would have made the scrum board a priority we probably would've had less issues.

To reach our MVP goals based on our project, we started by identifying the core features our project needed ro function. That was making sure the API data is fetching and rendering to the correct page. Also making sure we used the correct endpoints based on the API documentation.

If I could go back I would incorporate the scrum board into our daily meetings because that would help keep our tasks for the overall project clear.
