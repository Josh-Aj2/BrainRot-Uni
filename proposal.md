## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, RetroPlay is for users that love play retro games and want an easy to use website. It allows users to explore a list of 500,000+ retro games, create a profile, and save their favorite games.

## API & React Router

This application will use the [ API here], which provides detailed data about games, platforms, and genres. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

API key:

**Example:**

- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks
  - This will fetch an array of artwork objects
  - For each artwork, I want the `id`, `title`, and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/{id}
  - This will fetch a single artwork object
  - I will use the `id`, `title`, `short_description`, `medium_display`, `place_of_origin` and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q={query}
  - This will fetch a list of artworks that relate to the search query
  - For each artwork, I will use the `id` and `title`
